When not with his wife, Alex-Ross likes to play with his children, work on his videogame backlog (currently playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey) and geek the heck out of stuff.

Currently reading ~~to his children "The Two Towers" at night. It never fails to make them sleep~~ "Origin" by Dan Brown.
This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)


This blog is made using Jekyll and currently has the default theme, plus some changes Alex-Ross has been thinking to make about the layout and styles.
